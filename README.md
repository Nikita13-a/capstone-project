# üè° Real Estate Data Analysis & Modeling ‚Äì Capstone Project Overview

This project is a **comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline** built around real estate data (flats, houses, and Gurgaon property datasets). It combines **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, and insights generation** to create a robust property analysis and recommendation system.

### üìÇ Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Jupyter notebooks (`data-preprocessing-flats.ipynb`, `data-preprocessing-houses.ipynb`, `data-preprocessing-level-2.ipynb`) handle **cleaning raw datasets** by:

     * Removing duplicates & irrelevant features
     * Handling missing values (`missing-value-imputation.ipynb`)
     * Treating outliers (`outlier-treatment.ipynb`)
     * Generating cleaned datasets (`*_cleaned.csv`)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Performed via multiple notebooks:

     * **Univariate** (`eda-univariate-analysis.ipynb`)
     * **Multivariate** (`eda-multivariate-analysis.ipynb`)
     * **Automated profiling** (`eda-pandas-profiling.ipynb`)
     * **Visualization** (`data-visualization.ipynb`)
   * Helped uncover trends in **property prices, sizes, locations, and amenities**.

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**

   * `feature-engineering.ipynb` and `feature-selection.ipynb` extract meaningful variables such as:

     * Price per square foot
     * Location encoding (lat/long mapping using `latlong.csv`)
     * Categorical encoding of amenities & property type
   * `feature-selection-and-feature-engineering.ipynb` applies **statistical tests and model-based methods** to identify impactful features.

4. **Modeling**

   * **Baseline models** (`baseline model.ipynb`) built for property price prediction and recommendation.
   * **Model selection** (`model-selection.ipynb`) compares algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to optimize performance.

5. **Recommendation System**

   * Implemented in `recommender-system.ipynb`, designed to suggest properties based on **user preferences** (budget, location, property type).

6. **Insights Module**

   * `insights-module.ipynb` consolidates findings into actionable insights:

     * Best investment areas
     * Price distribution across localities
     * Effect of features (amenities, size, floor level) on property prices
   * Results summarized into `output_report.html` for stakeholders.
